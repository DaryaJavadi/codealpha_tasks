Here I used free API, because I tried to use microsoft's free f0 tier, but it was deleted by microsoft.
I tried to use google translator API, it asked for builling account. So this API is better one.

To see the result, run:
1)
pip install requests
pip install pyperclip
pip install pyttsx3

2)
python translator.py
